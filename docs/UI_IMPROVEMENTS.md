# UI Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Individual Step Counts Instead of Average
**Before:**
- Showed: "This will skip ~{X} steps on average"
- Single average number for all runs

**After:**
- Shows individual step counts for each selected run
- Format: "Steps to skip per run:"
  - "Run1: 15 steps"
  - "Run2: 23 steps" 
  - "Run3: 18 steps"

**Benefits:**
- More precise information per run
- Helps understand data length differences between runs
- Better insight into trimming effects on each experiment

### 2. Commented Out Right Column
**What was removed:**
- Run Info panel (right sidebar)
- Statistics tables (Min, Max, Final values)
- Run state information
- Trimming info panel

**Result:**
- Full-width plots for better visualization
- Cleaner, less cluttered interface
- Focus on data visualization rather than statistics
- More screen real estate for charts

## Code Changes

### Sidebar Info Update:
```python
# Old: Average calculation
st.sidebar.info(f"This will skip ~{int(avg_length * skip_percentage / 100)} steps on average")

# New: Individual run calculations
step_info = []
for run_name in selected_runs:
    run_data = df[df['name'] == run_name].iloc[0]
    hist_df = parse_history(run_data['history'])
    if not hist_df.empty and selected_metric in hist_df.columns:
        values = hist_df[selected_metric].dropna()
        if not values.empty:
            skip_count = int(len(values) * skip_percentage / 100)
            step_info.append(f"{run_name}: {skip_count} steps")

if step_info:
    st.sidebar.info("Steps to skip per run:\n" + "\n".join(step_info))
```

### Layout Simplification:
```python
# Old: Two-column layout
col1, col2 = st.columns([3, 1])
with col1:
    # Plot code
with col2:
    # Stats and info

# New: Full-width layout
# col1, col2 = st.columns([3, 1])  # Commented out
# with col1:  # Commented out
# Plot code directly
# with col2:  # All content commented out
```

## App Location
Updated app running at: **http://localhost:8505**

## Current Features
✅ Individual step counts per run in sidebar
✅ Full-width plots for better visualization
✅ Clean, uncluttered interface
✅ All previous functionality (trimming, plotting) intact
✅ Commented code easily restorable if needed
